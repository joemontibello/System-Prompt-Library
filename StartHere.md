# System Prompt Library: Concept and Need
The System Prompt Library is envisioned as a dynamic, user-centered digital repository designed for educators. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive collection of customizable prompts for Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), tailored specifically for educational use. In the rapidly evolving landscape of educational technology, such a library addresses the critical need for resources that help educators effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices. It serves as a bridge between the advanced capabilities of AI and the practical, pedagogical needs of the classroom, enabling educators to harness the power of GPTs for varied instructional purposes.

# Background: TutorBot Seminar, December 2023
In December of 2023, the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching (HILT) held a special seminar for invited guests to present and discuss their recent work on the development of customized GPTs for learning, or “tutorbots.” A series of small presentations were held as faculty and staff members from various schools demonstrated the many interfaces they are building for and testing in the classroom. Attendees learned about and discussed the functionalities of different systems, their potential improvements, how students are using these tools in course assignments and homework, and the future steps instructors are taking to generate more experimentation and exploration with similar technologies. Questions and comments raised throughout the event emphasized the importance of innovation, more Harvard-wide collaboration, and a call for more space to practice and experiment with other AI tools as such. The notion of a system prompt library stems from these discussions, with the purpose of fostering and enabling innovation through hands-on experimentation, collaboration, and sharing. 

# System Prompts
System prompts in the context of generative AI are pre-defined or structured inputs that guide the AI's response generation process. These prompts are often crafted by the system's designers or developers and are integral to the initial setup and ongoing functioning of the AI system. They serve as a foundational framework that determines how the AI interprets and responds to user inputs.

In contrast, prompts entered by an end user are the queries or commands that users input into the system to elicit specific responses or actions from the AI. These prompts are dynamic and can vary widely depending on the user's needs or intentions.

The key difference lies in their origin and function:
* Origin: System prompts are created by the system's developers and are embedded into the AI's programming. They reflect the intended use and capabilities of the AI. User prompts, on the other hand, are created by the users of the AI system and reflect their specific needs or queries.
* Function: System prompts guide the AI's baseline behavior and response framework. They set the parameters within which the AI operates. User prompts are inputs within this framework, guiding the AI's responses in real-time based on the user's specific request.

For example, in an educational AI tool designed to assist with learning, the system prompts might include structured questions or scenarios that align with pedagogical objectives. These would be crafted based on educational theories and research. When a student interacts with this tool, they might input prompts seeking explanations on specific topics or help with particular problems. The AI's response to these user prompts would be influenced by the underlying system prompts that have been designed to ensure that the tool's responses are pedagogically sound.
