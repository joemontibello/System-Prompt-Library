# System Prompts
System prompts in the context of generative AI are pre-defined or structured inputs that guide the AI's response generation process. These prompts are often crafted by the system's designers or developers and are integral to the initial setup and ongoing functioning of the AI system. They serve as a foundational framework that determines how the AI interprets and responds to user inputs.

In contrast, prompts entered by an end user are the queries or commands that users input into the system to elicit specific responses or actions from the AI. These prompts are dynamic and can vary widely depending on the user's needs or intentions.

The key difference lies in their origin and function:
* Origin: System prompts are created by the system's developers and are embedded into the AI's programming. They reflect the intended use and capabilities of the AI. User prompts, on the other hand, are created by the users of the AI system and reflect their specific needs or queries.
* Function: System prompts guide the AI's baseline behavior and response framework. They set the parameters within which the AI operates. User prompts are inputs within this framework, guiding the AI's responses in real-time based on the user's specific request.

For example, in an educational AI tool designed to assist with learning, the system prompts might include structured questions or scenarios that align with pedagogical objectives. These would be crafted based on educational theories and research. When a student interacts with this tool, they might input prompts seeking explanations on specific topics or help with particular problems. The AI's response to these user prompts would be influenced by the underlying system prompts that have been designed to ensure that the tool's responses are pedagogically sound.
