# System Prompts
System prompts in the context of generative AI are pre-defined or structured inputs that guide the AI's response generation process. These prompts are often crafted by the system's designers or developers and are integral to the initial setup and ongoing functioning of the AI system. They serve as a foundational framework that determines how the AI interprets and responds to user inputs.

In contrast, prompts entered by an end user are the queries or commands that users input into the system to elicit specific responses or actions from the AI. These prompts are dynamic and can vary widely depending on the user's needs or intentions.

The key difference lies in their origin and function:
* Origin: System prompts are created by the system's developers and are embedded into the AI's programming. They reflect the intended use and capabilities of the AI. User prompts, on the other hand, are created by the users of the AI system and reflect their specific needs or queries.
* Function: System prompts guide the AI's baseline behavior and response framework. They set the parameters within which the AI operates. User prompts are inputs within this framework, guiding the AI's responses in real-time based on the user's specific request.

For example, in an educational AI tool designed to assist with learning, the system prompts might include structured questions or scenarios that align with pedagogical objectives. These would be crafted based on educational theories and research. When a student interacts with this tool, they might input prompts seeking explanations on specific topics or help with particular problems. The AI's response to these user prompts would be influenced by the underlying system prompts that have been designed to ensure that the tool's responses are pedagogically sound.

## The Role of System Prompts in the Design of Learning Technologies
The role of a system prompt in the design of learning technologies is multifaceted and crucial for creating effective and engaging educational experiences. System prompts act as a structured guide for both the technology and the learner, facilitating interaction, engagement, and learning. Their roles can be broken down into several key aspects:

1. **Guiding Learner Interaction:** System prompts provide structured guidance to learners, helping them navigate the learning environment and understand what actions to take next. This is particularly important in self-directed learning environments where the learner might not have immediate access to a human instructor.

2. **Facilitating Engagement and Motivation:** Well-designed system prompts can be used to create engaging interactive agents that can guide and scaffold learning. For example, system prompts can be used to tell a chatbot how to respond to a student’s queries, such as by adopting a given perspective on an issue, responding with certain personality characteristics, using a socratic approach to answer a question, breaking down complex problems in step-by-step fashion, etc. These can help tailor interactions in ways that are relevant to the learner, bolstering engagement.

3. **Supporting Pedagogical Goals:** System prompts can be designed in alignment with the learning objectives and pedagogical approaches of the educational tool. This means that the prompts can not only guide the user interface interactions but also support the pedagogical strategies underlying the learning experience.

4. **Providing Feedback and Assessment:** In many learning technologies, system prompts play a critical role in delivering feedback and assessment. This could be in the form of immediate feedback on learner responses, hints to guide problem-solving, or adaptive assessments that adjust the difficulty level based on learner performance.

5. **Ensuring Content Accuracy and Relevance:** System prompts should accurately reflect the content and skills being taught. This is particularly important in domains where precision and accuracy are critical, such as in STEM education. The prompts should be regularly updated to ensure they remain relevant and reflect the current state of knowledge in the field.

6. **Encouraging Reflective Thinking and Metacognition:** System prompts can be designed to encourage learners to think about their own thinking and learning processes. Prompts that ask learners to reflect on what they have learned, how they have learned it, and what strategies were effective can foster metacognitive skills.

7. **Facilitating Adaptivity and Personalization:** In intelligent tutoring systems and other adaptive learning technologies, system prompts are integral to personalizing the learning experience. By responding to the learner's inputs, the system can adjust the level of challenge, the pace, and the style of content delivery, creating a learning experience that is tailored to the individual's needs.

8. **Enhancing Accessibility and Inclusivity:** System prompts can also play a role in making learning technologies accessible and inclusive. By providing alternative ways of interaction for learners with different needs, such as voice prompts for visually impaired learners or simplified language for younger learners, the technology can cater to a diverse range of users.

## Examples of System Prompts in Learning Technologies
Educators are using GPTs to create interactive learning experiences, simulate historical figures or scientists in classroom discussions, and provide personalized tutoring sessions. The system prompts in these contexts are carefully designed to elicit responses that align with educational goals, whether deeping one’s understanding of a subject, encouraging critical thinking, or facilitating a debate on ethical issues.

The role of system prompts in these educational GPT applications is foundational. They not only define the scope and direction of the interaction but also ensure that the engagements are pedagogically sound and aligned with learning objectives. By incorporating principles such as scaffolding, feedback loops, and differentiated instruction into the prompts, educators can create a variety of learning experiences that cater to the diverse needs of their students.

The content of these system prompts matters greatly for shaping such experiences with learners, and indeed, there are several approaches to system prompt design (C. Espinoza, personal communication, January 30, 2024). A few strategies include:
1. **Use of Examples:** Demonstrates that providing specific examples within prompts leads to more accurate and expected responses from the model. For instance, detailing a desired narrative style or data structure directly influences the output quality and relevance.
2. **Agent Definition / Impersonation:** Detailed character definitions yield better outcomes, especially with smaller models. Personalizing agents with rich backgrounds and objectives, such as "James," a tech-savvy teacher from rural Ohio, enhances the interaction quality and educational value.
3. **Storytelling / Roleplaying:** Addressing the models' tendency to conclude narratives, prompts can instruct to keep stories open, fostering a continuous and engaging learning environment.
4. **Using the Model to Generate the Prompt:** Investigating the generation of prompts by the model itself represents an innovative approach to create dynamic and contextually appropriate educational content.
5. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** This technique, which involves outlining a reasoning process step by step within the prompt, has shown efficacy in problem-solving scenarios, enabling models to produce more logical and coherent answers.
